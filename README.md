# 7 Day Investments

This project allows users to log into their RobinHood account and set up certain triggers for day trading.

## First Steps

You are going to need to install the reuqirements that we use. 
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed all of the requirements you can run the following command to get very basic data
```
python3 main.py -e <RobinHood Email> -p <RobinHood Password>
```
This will return a list of all current holdings and basic information about what it is that you are holding.
